## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Transaction Failures

- Ensure you have enough RBTC for gas fees
- Verify recipient address format (0x...)
- Check network compatibility (mainnet/testnet)

#### Connection Issues

- Verify your internet connection
- App automatically switches to offline mode when network unavailable
- Limited functionality available offline (wallet management, contacts, tokens)

#### API Key Issues

- Ensure API key is valid for the selected network (mainnet/testnet)
- Keys are validated against Rootstock RPC endpoints
- Invalid keys will show clear error messages

#### Wallet Issues

- Confirm wallet file exists at `~/.local/share/rsk-rust-cli/`
- Check file permissions if access is denied
- Ensure you're using the correct network (mainnet/testnet)

## Security

This application handles private keys and financial transactions. Security measures include:

- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM encryption for private keys with authenticated encryption
- **File Security**: Secure file permissions (0o600) for wallet files
- **Password Security**: Strong password validation with complexity requirements
- **Memory Security**: Memory zeroization for sensitive data to prevent leaks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **API Security**: API key validation against Rootstock networks
- **Offline Security**: Core wallet functions available without network exposure

**Dependency Status:** All security vulnerabilities resolved. Minor unmaintained dependency warnings (derivative, paste) are transitive dependencies via Alloy and pose no security risk.
